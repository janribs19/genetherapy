        <h1>What is Gene Therapy?</h1>
        <p>Gene therapy is an advanced medical technique that involves modifying or repairing genes within a person’s cells to treat or prevent diseases. Unlike traditional treatments, which often focus on managing symptoms, gene therapy aims to address the underlying genetic causes of diseases at their source—our DNA. It’s primarily used for genetic disorders, some types of cancer, and certain viral infections.</p>

        <p>Gene therapy is a cutting-edge medical approach designed to treat or prevent diseases by directly modifying the genes within a person’s cells. Genes, which are made up of DNA, serve as instructions for how the body grows, functions, and repairs itself. When a gene is faulty or missing, it can lead to a variety of health problems, from inherited genetic disorders to certain types of cancer. Gene therapy seeks to address these issues at their root cause by introducing, repairing, or altering genetic material to restore normal function. By targeting the underlying genetic defects, gene therapy represents a revolutionary shift in medicine, offering hope for treating conditions that were previously considered untreatable.</p>
